        Since the age of 9-10 i've had an obsession with game development. So I
        took is upon myself to learn it. With a lot of free time I was able to
        learn the basics in scratch, and with time, the basics of unity. As of
        right now I am working on a game called: 'Hollowed Dawn'. It will be
        release on <a href="" class="PostHref" target="_blank">my itch.io page</a>! Not only was this fun, but i learned a lot of skills that I could use in
        real life. Such as,</p>

        One of the things that brings me a lot of joy 
        in this world is skate-boarding. I like the challenge of it and the 
        rewarding feeling when you learn something new. I've been taking skating 
        seriously for about 2-3 years as of now, though I started pushing around 
        on a board when I was around 6 years old. Through this time, I ended up 
        learning a few tricks. Those being the,<a href=""></a>

        The band 'Rare Americans' is a British Columbia based band with a fairly small following. They have been a large part of my life for a while now. I
        discovered them through their largest song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gtv40bOE3U4" class="PostHref">Brittle Bones Nicky</a>!
        This happened about 4-5 years ago and ever since then, I have loved listening to them. They have a show in development called 'The Crooked City', and a movie being made for BBN! I can't wait for them to come out!
